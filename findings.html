				  	  <p>User interviews are important to conduct because they can provide you with qualitative information about the type of people that may potentially be viewing your website or product and can give you further insight on the type of features that these users would expect to see. For this project, the questions asked were all established before the interview and were primarily focused on the interviewee's background and any previous experiences that they've had with viewing online portfolios. Their answers were then used to help further the creation of the user journey for my portfolio.</p>

			 	  	  <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
				  	  <p>A competitor analysis is done during the discovery phase of design in order to look at what other competitors are doing and how they are doing it. From this gathering of information you can then see what has been working and what hasn't and then incorporate the findings into your own design. For this site, the types of competitors reviewed were primarily some sort of UX professionals who designed their own portfolio site along with some fellow students. The reason they were viewed as competitors was because they are in the same sort of job market as me and can be viewed as competition for the types of jobs that I will be trying to acquire.</p>

			 	  	  <h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
				  	  <p>The feature value matrix was created in order to organize features based off of their user value, technical effort and business value. Each feature was given a score under these three categories with 1 being the least effort put in and 5 being the most. These sums then help determine which features should be prioritized. The features that were selected for this site were chosen after listening to user interviews and doing a competitive analysis. These features seemed to be what are considered the most essential features for a successful portfolio to have.</p>

			 	  	  <h3>Feature Value Prioritization</h3>
				  	  <p>For feature prioritization, the features that had the lowest scores took the highest priority in development since they would be of minimal effort to implement and would add quality to the site. In order to visualize this feature prioritization better, a kano model was developed to show what were considered basic necessities, performance features, delightful features, and unnecessary to implement features. By prioritizing these features I was able to figure out which items were absolutely necessary to first implement into my interface in order to have a meaningful portfolio.</p>

Writing these stories helps me as the designer figure out the situation, motivation and expected outcome that users expect when interacting with a specific feature on my portfolio. For these stories I mainly focused on creating stories that applied to hiring managers and UX/PM leads since they are the ones that my portfolio is primarily geared towards. </p>

			 	  	  <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
				  	  <p>Multiple cognitive walkthroughs were conducted as an evaluation method in order to walk through a set of specific tasks that pertain to this portfolio. Participants acted as users of the site and were asked to perform certain tasks and answer questions in order to figure out their thought process behind the steps that were being taken. This process is very important because the information gathered from these walkthroughs can then be used to identify any underlying usability issues of the site. You can then redesign certain aspects of your site based on these newly found issues. Some challenges that occurred while performing these walkthroughs was that it was often hard to get users to talk as they were doing a task. I would often have to prompt them for more information so that I could get a better insight of why they were performing the task in this specific way. For some of the more broad questions it was also hard to determine what to take into consideration for a redesign since some participants seemed to have differing views on what they liked/disliked about the overall site.</p>

			 	  	  <h3>User Tests</h3>
				  	  <p>The two types of user tests that were conducted for this website were question tests and click tests. A click test was used in order to show how users would potentially interact with the site and where they were most likely to click when posed with a specific task. Question tests on the other hand offer more insight as they allow you to see what the user believes a specific feature is for. It helps verify that a specific action or feature will do what users expect to happen. These two tests were chosen because their potential results seem to offer the most insight as to how my portfolio design could be improved in certain areas. Some challenges that occurred while analyzing these results was that it was often hard to tell why people were clicking certain areas for a click test. Most people passed on filling out an explanation so it was hard for me to really understand why they were clicking in the incorrect place. It is also hard to determine if the people completing these tests actually took the time to answer these questions to the best of their ability since people often don't care about completing it as much as I would like them too. From looking at these test results though I was able to see that for the most part my site was easy for users to understand and get the main point across; however, some usability issues arose from not having a more clear navigation bar in certain areas. </p>

			 	  <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
				  <p>By conducting user research for my site, I was able to create a site that I believe effectively delivers my content in an easy to understand way. The journey of creating my site started with me conducting multiple user interviews and competitor analysis. Having user interviews first allowed me to get an idea of the types of information that people are typically used to seeing in a portfolio. I was then able to take these pieces of information one step further and conduct research online in order to see how people have already been incorporating certain features into their own portfolios. By seeing what sorts of portfolios were already out there I was able to get an idea of how I should be structuring/designing my portfolio, and also how I could be incorporating specific features and functionalities into my site. With all of these potential ideas in my head I was then able to create a feature value matrix and a feature prioritization model in order to prioritize the types of features that I wanted to add to my site so that I could began coding in a time efficient manner. The conclusions that I drew from all of this user research was that there were specific features that I would need to implement in order to have a successful portfolio that would catch the interest of potential employers.</p>
				  <p>After creating a full functioning website, it was time for me to conduct user testing for for my portfolio. From creating user stories I was able to take a step back from my site and develop more of a story for each feature on my portfolio. These stories allowed me to see whether or not an intended user would be able to successfully accomplish what they came to my site to do and if the right feedback would be displayed whenever an action was completed. Along with this, three cognitive walkthroughs were conducted in order to test my site. While doing these walkthroughs I realized that there were some underlying issues with my site that I hadn't even thought about before. Multiple participants mentioned that on my project pages there was no "Home" or "Back" button on my navigation bar so it was confusing to figure out how to get back to the main part of my site. They also expected there to be some more functionality when clicking on specific items such as the project images in my "Work" section and my full name header. Participants also seemed to be scrolling a lot through the site as opposed to using the navigation bar since the bar was only seen at the top of the page. Some participants also mentioned that the site could be modernized a little bit more in design since the buttons looked a little outdated and didn't seem to match the rest of the website. After hearing these things I realized that there was some features that I wanted to fix/add and after conducting my task based tests soon after I realized that the some of the same issues were being brought up again. From looking at the results of my tasks based tests I noticed that people were having trouble navigating through my site using the navigation bar. They didn't know how to get back to the home page and also expected certain areas of my site to have more functionality than what was currently present. Overall this process of user testing helped me take a step back from my site design and realize some underlying issues that I couldn't originally detect on my own. It was nice to have a fresh set of eyes looking at the site and giving me honest feedback so that I could then realize that some changes were necessary to make in order to improve my site.</p>
					  
		  	 	 <p>Although I was able to successfully complete my project, I still am aware of the fact that there were a lot of challenges that came with making this site. At first it was hard to narrow down how I wanted my site to look. With so many other portfolios to look at I started getting overwhelmed because I didn't think I would be able to design and implement a site up to the same standard as other portfolios online. Before this class I had never even looked at HTML, CSS or Javascript so I couldn't even imagine how it would be to try and implement so many different functionalities; however, I quickly learned that the content being displayed is much more important than the extra frill of the website. Once I started focusing on my content I was able to successfully lay out my site and begin coding something that I could be proud of. </p>
					  
				 <p>The only other challenge that I faced during this project occurred with the testing process after my site was built. In particular, the cognitive walkthrough and task based tests made me question some of my design choices. Participants in my cognitive walkthrough had contradicting opinions about certain aspects of my site so overall it was a challenge for me to figure out whether or not I should implement these participants suggestions into my site. Along with this, it was a challenge when it came to looking at the results of my task based tests. For some of the click tests multiple users clicked on something that seemed obviously wrong to me so it was a challenge in understanding why someone would potentially click on this specific area. However after spending time analyzing these results and challenges I learned that people will always have differing views of what is right or what can be improved and that it is up to me as a designer to figure out how I want to address some of these issues and to not get to caught up on one specific thing.</p>

			 	  <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
				  <p>
				  
				  For my midterm, the only feedback that I received was that I could use a bit more semantic HTML in my site. So for my final site I tried to incorporate and will continue to improve the use of semantic markup language. The rest of the findings that were then incorporated into my site came primarily from the results of my task based tests and my cognitive walkthroughs. </p>
				  
				  <p>In terms of site functionality, the first thing that posed a big issue for my site was the fact that my navigation bar had no back option once the user was done viewing one of my project pages. In order to fix this issue I decided to create a new navigation bar for these project pages. Instead of having the options of "About", "Work", and "Contact" for the navigation bar, I decided to instead simplify the options and just created an option that says "Back to Main Page". I believe that this new design is much easier to follow and seems more relevant to the specific page that the user is on. This will hopefully reduce any confusion with how to get back to the main page of my site. Another edit that I made to the navigation bar was that I created a sticky navigation bar so that when the user scrolls down on the site the navigation bar will move as well. I believe that adding this will allow users to utilize my navigation bar more since they will no longer have to scroll back to the top of the page to access it again. Participants in both the task based tests and cognitive walkthroughs also led me to the idea of having my project pictures in my "Work" section serve as a hyperlink to my project pages. Since people often click pictures as well I decided that this would be a nice function to add to my site. With so many different suggestions for potential things to add it was a challenge to choose what new functionalities I wanted to add to my site and while I did not implement all the suggestions made from the user tests I do believe that I did incorporate the onesthat I believed would significantly improve my website.</p>
				  
				  <p> Aside from adding new functionalities to my site I also changed the design of my site quite a bit. When I first created my site I was worried that it would be too plain so I added unnecessary colors and borders thinking that it would make my site look better. However after implementing my site and testing it with users I received feedback that it did in fact look a little outdated because of the way I designed it. </p>
				  
				  <p>I enjoy very minimalistic sites and follow many blogs that follow this sort of "hipster/minimalistic" design so I wanted to mimic this in my new design. I got rid of the unnecessary colors in my navigation bar and instead aimed for a more black and white approach. I also took out the border of my site because it really didn't add much value to my site at all. Instead, I broke my site content into blocked sections to make it look more like different posts such as how a blog works rather than just having one full page. I also updated the buttons in my "Work" section and instead replaced them with links. All of these features were things that I had originally thought about doing in my first design however it wasn't until after I heard feedback from my user tests that I was confident enough to make the site how I wanted it to be. It was a challenge trying to think of how my site should look so that it can appeal to my potential users; however, I also realized that this site is a portrayal of myself and that I also need to do what I want (to an extent) so that the site can showcase not only my work but also the type of person that I am. After making these design changes I am much happier with how my design looks and believe that it serves its purpose of representing both me and my work well.</p>

		 <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
		 <h3>Atrina Pebdani- Aspiring user researcher, social media addict, coffee shop enthusiast and future Yelp Elite member.</h3><br />
		  
		  			<p>Currently I am studying Informatics at the University of California, Irvine. As a senior I am constantly looking to find new 
		 			opportunities that will allow me to acquire new skills that will facilitate my passion to create a better connected world through
   					technology by pursuing opportunities that will allow me to gain more insight into the social media, technology, and business industries. My main interests deal with 
   					learning about how the technology being developed today can be created in a new and revolutionary way and can lead towards an addictive mindset. I want to be able to help create pieces of technology
   					that could have never been imagined before. My goal is to become a user researcher so that not only work with technology, but also understand the way in which people think and act and how that determines whether or not a piece of technology will be succesful in today's constantly changing world.

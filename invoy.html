		 			   <h3>Overall Objective</h3>
		  			   <p>During this past summer, I received the opportunity to be a Client Experience 
					   	Intern at Invoy Technologies in Aliso Viejo, CA. During this time I focused on 
						enhancing client communication and brainstorming new ways to improve
						the overall user experience of the application. Along with this, I tested the company's
						app daily for any potential software bugs and took part in weekly software meetings 
						in order to come up with new design features for the application.

		 				 <h2>Yelp Redesign Project</h2>
		 				 <h3>Overall Objective</h3>
		 
		  				 <p>During my time at UCI I completed the following project dealing with Human Computer Interaction.
					 	 The main goal of this project was to redesign some sort of app or service in order to learn and
					 	 practice the process of user experience design and engineering. After learning different methods
					 	 for user research, user interface design, evaluation and experimental design, my team was able
					 	 to come up with potential design alternatives for the yelp.com website in order to enhance
					 	 the user experience.
